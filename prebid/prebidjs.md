## What is Prebid.js

<p class="main-text">Prebid is a free open source library and community that helps publishers implement Header Bidding on their websites & apps.</p>

<p class="main-text">Header Bidding (also known as header auctions, parallel bidding, or header bidding) is a technique that involves running SSP & Ad Exchange code directly on page so publishers can receive bids on their inventory that may be unavailable through their primary ad server and exchange.</p>

<p class="main-text">The returned bids are then passed into the ad server so they can compete with direct demand and the primary ad server’s exchange on a level playing field.</p>

## A Brief History of Header Bidding

<p class="main-text">In the early days of Header Bidding were dominated by bad practices, closed proprietary tech, poor standards, and little to no cooperation between competing companies. The result for publishers was headache - having to manually patch together various solutions from different companies and hope their developer didn’t spend 3 weeks coding the wrong thing.</p>
